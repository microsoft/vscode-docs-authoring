# Contributing to Docs Authoring Pack 

Interested in making a code contribution and not sure where to begin? Check out our [help wanted issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs-authoring/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). If you want to make an enhancement, create an issue with the proposed change for review.

## Getting Started with Development Environment

Navigate to the root directory `vscode-docs-authoring` and run `yarn install`. This will install all dependencies for each of the extension packages. To work on an extension navigate to that package folder directory. For example: if you want to work on the docs-markdown extension, navigate to `vscode-docs-authoring/packages/docs-markdown` and open the folder in VSCode. Run the extension by hitting F5 to run the Extension Host.

Pre-push hooks will run when doing a push to your upstream or origin branch. This hook will check that all of the extensions compile and lint without errors.
